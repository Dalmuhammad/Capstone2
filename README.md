The AWS SaaS Sales dataset provides transactional data from a hypothetical B2B SaaS company specializing in sales and marketing software. Each row represents a product within a transaction, with detailed information such as unique identifiers for each transaction and order, dates, customer and contact details, and geographical data (country, city, region, and subregion). Additionally, it captures customer specifics like industry and segment, alongside product details, sales amounts, quantities, discounts, and profits. This dataset offers valuable insights for analyzing profit, sales performance across different regions and customer segments, etc.

In the dataset, each row represents a product in a transaction, and the columns include:
 1. Row ID: A unique identifier for each transaction.
 2. Order ID: A unique identifier for each order.
 3. Order Date: The date when the order was placed.
 4. Date Key: A numerical representation of the order date (YYYYMMDD).
 5. Contact Name: The name of the person who placed the order.
 6. Country: The country where the order was placed.
 7. City: The city where the order was placed.
 8. Region: The region where the order was placed.
 9. Subregion: The subregion where the order was placed.
 10. Customer: The name of the company that placed the order.
 11. Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer.
 12. Industry: The industry the customer belongs to.
 13. Segment: The customer segment (SMB, Strategic, Enterprise, etc.).
 14. Product: The product was ordered.
 15. License: The license key for the product.
 16. Sales: The total sales amount for the transaction.
 17. Quantity: The total number of items in the transaction.
 18. Discount: The discount applied to the transaction.
 19. Profit: The profit from the transaction


In this analysis, we aim to identify factors that can drive an increase in profit while simultaneously pinpointing potential risks that may reduce profitability. By examining product performance, customer segments, and regional variations, etc., we will seek to understand which strategies could maximize returns and where losses may be minimized. This approach will help us develop data-driven recommendations for enhancing profit stability and mitigating risks associated with variability in sales and discounts.
